# Network Packet Analyzer

## Project Overview
This Network Packet Analyzer is a real-time tool developed to capture and analyze network traffic. It displays essential information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol types, and payload data. Built for educational purposes, the tool helps users gain insights into network communication.

## Features
- Real-time packet capture and display.
- Customizable filters (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, or all).
- User-friendly GUI with dynamic resizing.
- Smooth and efficient operations using threading.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Scapy**: For packet sniffing and analysis.
- **Tkinter**: GUI development.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required packages: `scapy`

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

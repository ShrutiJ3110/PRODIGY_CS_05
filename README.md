# Network Packet Analyzer

## Project Overview
This Network Packet Analyzer is a real-time tool developed to capture and analyze network traffic. It displays essential information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol types, and payload data. Built for educational purposes, the tool helps users gain insights into network communication.

## Features
- Real-time packet capture and display.
- Customizable filters (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, or all).
- User-friendly GUI with dynamic resizing.
- Smooth and efficient operations using threading.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Scapy**: For packet sniffing and analysis.
- **Tkinter**: GUI development.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required packages: `scapy`

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   ```

3. Run the analyzer:
   ```bash
   python analyzer.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. Launch the tool.
2. Select the desired packet filter (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, or all).
3. Click the **Start Sniffing** button to capture packets.
4. View real-time packet details in the display area.
5. Click the **Stop Sniffing** button to stop capturing packets.
